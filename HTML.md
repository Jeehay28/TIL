# HTML Headings

### HTML Headings
  - HTML headings are defined with the `<h1`> to `<h6>` tags.
  - `<h1>` defines the most important heading. 
  - `<h6>` defines the least important heading.
  - `<h1>` > `<h2>` > `<h3>` > `<h4>` > `<h5>` > `<h6>`

### Headings Are Important
  - Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
  - Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
  - `<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.
  
### Note
  - Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

# HTML Paragraphs

### HTML Paragraphs
  - The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.
  - A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

### HTML Horizontal Rules
  - The HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph.
  - A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

### HTML Line Breaks
  - The HTML `<br>` element defines a line break.
  - Use `<br>` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.
  - The `<br>` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

### HTML `<pre>` Element
  - The HTML `<pre>` element defines preformatted text.
  - The text inside a `<pre>` element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks.

### Example
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>

</body>
</html>
```
