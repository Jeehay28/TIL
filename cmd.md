### CLI stands for:
- Command Line Interface
- Command Line Interpreter
- Command Line Input

- CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

- In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers.

- In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.

- Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

- However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.
