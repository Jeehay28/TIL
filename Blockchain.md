# Blockchain
- a data structure
- a linked list or chain of unique "blocks"
- a list of transactions

# Ethereum
- a secure platform for storing, updating, and removing data from a blockchain using "smart contracts"


# Smart Contracts
- programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met
- a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions 
  according to the terms of a contract or an agreement

# Solidity
- a popular programming language for developing smart contracts
- designed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)


# Proof of Work (PoW)
- a form of adding new blocks of transactions to a cryptocurrency's blockchain


# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
- a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism used to validate transactions through randomly selected validators

# Hash
- a function that meets the encrypted demands needed to solve for a blockchain computation.


# SHA-256
- stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit
- used for cryptographic security
- Cryptographic hash algorithms produce irreversible and unique hashes


# Bitcoin
- "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" 
- decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network
- Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain
- Hash function: SHA-256


# Token
- a digital asset defined by a project or smart contract and built on a specific blockchain
- can be UTILITY TOKENS or SECURITY TOKENS


# Difference between Coin and Token
- crypto coins: the native asset of a Blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum, 
- crypto tokens: created by platforms and applications that are built on top of an existing Blockchain
